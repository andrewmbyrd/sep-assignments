Doubling the size of the original array is done in order to make room for new elements after a collision is detected. This particular way of handling collision
is not ideal for several reasons. First, the size of the array is getting enormous, fast. It's size is growing at Theta(2^n) which is the least efficient growth rate.
Also, by doubling, we ensure that the size of the array is always even. Since we're determining index location based on modulo of the size, having an even
number as the size of the array increases the chances of multiple numbers "modulo-ing" to the same index.
