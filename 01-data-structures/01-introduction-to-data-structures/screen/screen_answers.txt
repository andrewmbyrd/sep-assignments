1. A matrix is initialized with user-specified dimensions for width and height.
In this case, we're concerned with inserting Pixels into a Screen. Using the insert
method, the user can insert a generic object (in this case a pixel) in to
the specified row and column from the x and y coordinates.

To read data, the at method returns whatever is in that row and column of the matrix

2. I added a search method that allows you to search for a generic object
if it exists in the matrix, the method will return to you an array
with the row, column location. Else it will return nil. Searching for
and item that may or may not be in the matrix could take as many runs as there
are cells in the matrix

3. A matrix could represent a Bingo card, a chess board, etc.
